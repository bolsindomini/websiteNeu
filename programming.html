                <h3>The Kill Room</h3>
                <p>Patrice Capullo has a problem: her art gallery isn't making any money. Gordon has an even bigger problem: while arranging murders is lucrative for the mob, he and his friend Reggie need a better way to launder their money. Through a chance acquaintance of Patrices' drug dealer, the art world meets the underworld and a plan is hatched. The only catch is that Patrice needs something to sell. So Reggie taps into his inner artist and produces a painting that immediately sells for an incredibly high price. When the hefty price for this new mystery artist accidentally leaks out, the art career of "The Bagman" is born, attracting attention and press, which doesn't sit well with his underworld superior.
