                <h3>The Kill Room</h3>
                <p>
                    Patrice Capullo has a problem: her art gallery isn't making any money. Gordon has an even bigger
                    problem: while arranging murders is lucrative for the mob, he and his friend Reggie need a better
                    way to launder their money. Through a chance acquaintance of Patrices' drug dealer, the art world
                    meets the underworld and a plan is hatched. The only catch is that Patrice needs something to
                    sell.<br />
                    So Reggie taps into his inner artist and produces a painting that immediately sells for an
                    incredibly high price. When the hefty price for this new mystery artist accidentally leaks out, the
                    art career of "The Bagman" is born, attracting attention and press, which doesn't sit well with his
                    underworld superior.
